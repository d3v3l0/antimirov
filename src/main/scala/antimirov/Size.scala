/**
 * Extended integer representation of sizes.
 *
 * This class is used to represent the lengths of matched strings.
 * Unbounded values are generated by things like the Kleene star
 * operator.
 *
 * Size supports addition and multiplication. Additionally, Size has a
 * total ordering (unbounded values are considered), so comparisons
 * are also supported.
 *
 * Sizes are required to be non-negative, i.e. 0 <= size < ∞.
